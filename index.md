<h1>Hi, I’m Shah 👋</h1>

<p>
  I'm an <strong>AI theorist</strong> and engineer focused on building intelligent systems that combine rigorous reasoning with creative design. I recently completed my Master’s in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I specialized in <strong>natural language processing</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>intelligent system architecture</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  My work blends analytical depth with system-level creativity — from designing multi-agent LLM architectures and abductive reasoning models to generating emotionally expressive music and building AI-driven SaaS tools.
</p>

<p><strong>Core project areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Abductive reasoning and hypothesis selection with LLMs</li>
  <li>Multimodal ML for interview outcome prediction (text + prosody)</li>
  <li>Fake news detection using BERT and Transformers</li>
  <li>Emotion-aware harmony & music generation (Wolfie)</li>
  <li>Multi-agent AI accounting assistant (Lantern, SaaS)</li>
</ul>
