<h1>Hi, I’m Shahriar 👋</h1>

<p>
  I'm an <strong>AI theorist</strong> and engineer focused on building intelligent systems that bridge rigorous reasoning with creative design. I recently completed my Master’s in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I specialized in <strong>natural language processing</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>cognitive system architecture</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  My work brings together analytical precision and imaginative system-building — from forecasting economic trends and detecting misinformation to generating emotionally expressive music and designing multi-agent AI platforms.
</p>

<p>Core project areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multimodal ML for interview outcome prediction (text + prosody)</li>
  <li>Fake news detection using BERT and Transformers</li>
  <li>Emotion-aware harmony & music generation (Wolfie)</li>
  <li>Multi-agent AI accounting assistant (Lantern, SaaS)</li>
  <li>Housing and rent forecasting using time series modeling</li>
</ul>
