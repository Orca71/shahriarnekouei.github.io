<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Shahriar ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>
  I'm an AI/ML engineer and creative technologist with a passion for transforming bold ideas into working systems. Currently completing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, I specialize in building thoughtful, scalable solutions using <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>natural language processing</strong>, and <strong>creative AI</strong>.
</p>

<p>My work blends rigor with imaginationâ€”whether forecasting housing markets, detecting misinformation, or composing emotionally expressive music with code.</p>

<p>Core project areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time series forecasting (housing and rent prediction)</li>
  <li>Multimodal NLP for explainable interview scoring</li>
  <li>Fake news detection using transformers</li>
  <li>Emotion-aware AI music generation (Wolfie)</li>
</ul>
