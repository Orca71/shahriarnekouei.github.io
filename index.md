# Hi, Iâ€™m Shahriar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist with a passion for solving real-world problems using **machine learning**, **NLP**, and **creative AI**. I'm currently finishing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, and I've worked on projects in:

- Time series forecasting (housing and rent prediction)
- NLP for explainable interview scoring
- Fake news detection
- Emotion-aware AI music generation

This site is a collection of my favorite work. Feel free to explore my projects, read more about my process, or [connect with me](mailto:your.email@example.com).
