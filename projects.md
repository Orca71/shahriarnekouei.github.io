## üè† Colorado Housing & Rent Forecasting

**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, statsmodels, SARIMAX, Ridge/ElasticNet  
**Description**:  
Built a multi-linear regression and time series pipeline to forecast housing prices and rent trends across Colorado using Zillow and economic indicators. Validated with SARIMAX and neural networks.  
**Key highlights**:  
- R¬≤ ‚âà 0.87  
- Time-series aware training/test split  
- Economic interpretability with explainability techniques

## üß† Explainable Interview Scoring with NLP

**Tools**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Random Forest, SHAP  
**Description**:  
Built a multimodal machine learning model to predict interview scores (performance and excitement) using language and prosodic features. Applied explainable ML methods to interpret results.  
**Key highlights**:  
- 5-fold CV with TF-IDF and Word2Vec  
- Random Forest and FNN comparison  
- Used MIT Interview Dataset

## üì∞ Fake News Detection with NLP

**Tools**: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Word Embeddings  
**Description**:  
Developed a fake news classification model using the LIAR dataset. Applied feature selection, precision/recall analysis, and evaluated Word2Vec-based approaches.  
**Key highlights**:  
- Preprocessed 6-class ‚Üí binary labels  
- Improved recall using rebalancing and embedding techniques

## üéº Wolfie: Emotion-Aware Classical Music Generation

**Tools**: PrettyMIDI, rule-based chord logic, NLP-driven motif design  
**Description**:  
A personal research project that fuses harmony theory with machine learning. Wolfie generates music from emotional or poetic input using symbolic AI and neural network techniques.  
**Key highlights**:  
- Circle of fifths + cadence logic  
- Mood-to-chord generator (rule-based)  
- Preparing for LSTM/Transformer melody generation
