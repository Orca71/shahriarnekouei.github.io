# Projects

Here are some of the most exciting projects I've worked on ‚Äî combining machine learning, NLP, time series forecasting, and music AI.

## üè† Colorado Housing & Rent Forecasting

**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Elastic Net, XGBoost, SARIMAX  
**Description**:  
Ongoing time series modeling project to forecast rent and mortgage trends for Colorado single-family homes using Zillow and economic indicators. Applied transformations, lag features, and regression diagnostics.  
**Key highlights**:  
- R¬≤ up to 0.97 on validation  
- Elastic Net and XGBoost models for multicollinearity and performance  
- Time-series aware training/test split  
- Interpretable with SHAP and feature correlation  
- Final code in progress

## üß† Multimodal Interview Scoring with NLP

**Tools**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, prosodic features, Random Forest, FNN, SHAP  
**Description**:  
Developed a multimodal machine learning pipeline to predict excitement and performance scores from interviews using both textual (NLP) and prosodic (audio) features. Applied explainable ML techniques to interpret model predictions.  
**Key highlights**:  
- 5-fold cross-validation using TF-IDF and Word2Vec  
- Multimodal models outperformed unimodal baselines  
- SHAP and correlation analysis for interpretability  
- Based on the MIT Interview dataset  
- Final report and results complete

##üì∞ Fake News Detection with NLP (Completed)##

Tools: BERT, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Gradio
Description:
A binary fake news classification project using the LIAR dataset (12K+ labeled political statements). The project explores both traditional NLP pipelines and transformer-based models. The final deployment uses a fine-tuned BERT model served through a web demo.

Key Highlights:

Converted 6-class labels into binary: Real vs Fake

Achieved ~63% test accuracy with fine-tuned BERT

Evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

Compared baseline models: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, XGBoost

‚úÖ Deployed a live Gradio demo via Hugging Face Spaces

## üéº Wolfie: AI-Powered Mood-Based Music Generator *(In Progress)*

**Tools**: Python, PrettyMIDI, FluidSynth, Symbolic AI, Music Theory  
**Description**:  
An original music generation system that composes emotionally expressive chord progressions and melodies based on user-selected moods and classical harmony logic. Wolfie blends symbolic AI and music theory with the foundations of generative models.

**Key highlights**:  
- Rule-based chord generation (Circle of Fifths, cadences, key modes)  
- Melody creation with customizable inversion, tempo, and emotion  
- Outputs expressive MIDI compositions  
- Inspired by Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven  
- Currently integrating LSTMs and deep learning for expressive control
