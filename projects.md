## üè† Colorado Housing & Rent Forecasting

**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Elastic Net, XGBoost, SARIMAX  
**Description**:  
Ongoing time series modeling project to forecast rent and mortgage trends for Colorado single-family homes using Zillow and economic indicators. Applied transformations, lag features, and regression diagnostics.  
**Key highlights**:  
- R¬≤ up to 0.97 on validation  
- Elastic Net and XGBoost models for multicollinearity and performance  
- Time-series aware training/test split  
- Interpretable with SHAP and feature correlation  
- Final code in progress

## üß† Multimodal Interview Scoring with NLP

**Tools**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, prosodic features, Random Forest, FNN, SHAP  
**Description**:  
Developed a multimodal machine learning pipeline to predict excitement and performance scores from interviews using both textual (NLP) and prosodic (audio) features. Applied explainable ML techniques to interpret model predictions.  
**Key highlights**:  
- 5-fold cross-validation using TF-IDF and Word2Vec  
- Multimodal models outperformed unimodal baselines  
- SHAP and correlation analysis for interpretability  
- Based on the MIT Interview dataset  
- Final report and results complete

## üì∞ Fake News Detection with NLP

**Tools**: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Word Embeddings  
**Description**:  
Developed a fake news classification model using the LIAR dataset. Applied feature selection, precision/recall analysis, and evaluated Word2Vec-based approaches.  
**Key highlights**:  
- Preprocessed 6-class ‚Üí binary labels  
- Improved recall using rebalancing and embedding techniques

## üéº Wolfie: Emotion-Aware Classical Music Generation

**Tools**: PrettyMIDI, rule-based chord logic, NLP-driven motif design  
**Description**:  
A personal research project that fuses harmony theory with machine learning. Wolfie generates music from emotional or poetic input using symbolic AI and neural network techniques.  
**Key highlights**:  
- Circle of fifths + cadence logic  
- Mood-to-chord generator (rule-based)  
- Preparing for LSTM/Transformer melody generation
